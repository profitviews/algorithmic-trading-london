## Beginnings

A [first "meetup"](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/algorithmic-trading-meet-greet-tickets-819926100037) - not organised through meetup.com - was held at [The Betjeman Arms](https://www.thebetjemanarms.co.uk/) pub in St Pancras station.  It was held there as much as anything because one of the organizers' train back home was to leave from that station.  It was organized last-minute and a Â£9 charge was levied (because there was such limited space).  

Nevertheless a good turnout of about 15 people, all of whom had varied interesting angles on the subject of algorithmic trading resulted.  The result was that it was a great evening for everyone.

Due to the good feeling that arose from this first event, it was decided to hold another.  At the Betjeman event, one enthusiastic participant Kum Nathan said that he had an algo he'd worked on that he was prepared to talk about in a future event.  That was enough to schedule the next event.
